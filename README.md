## Installation and Usage
* Download the latest release from https://github.com/baffler/Transparent-Twitch-Chat-Overlay/releases
* You can download the Installer now to make it easier to install the program and it will automatically install the required dependencies ([WebView2 runtimes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)).
* "Windows protected your PC" message may appear which is the Windows Defender Smart Screen. You'll need to click "More info" and then "Run anyway". You'll only have to do this the first time you launch it.

* You can move the application by clicking and dragging the thin black border at top, and you can resize it by clicking and dragging the grip at the bottom-right
